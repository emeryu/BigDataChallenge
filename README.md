The following contents within this main directory include the packages, 
libraries, dataset and the workflow that is used in this analysis. 

The scripts should be run in the folling order to gain replicatory results. This also serves as our workflow.

    1. MainScript.R
    
    (Reads raw data file and creates output folders where graphs will be saved )

    2. Data.Cleaning.R
    
    (Deletes missing data points, renames columns and creates mass columns)


    3. Analysis.Graphs.R
    
    (runs regression analysis between the dependent variable (mass) and the explanatory variables, saves regrssions results, generates graphs and stores them in correct folders)
